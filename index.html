        <h1 class="mainTitle">A list of great mods for Terraria</h1> 

        <article>
            <p>
                Have you wanted to start a new modded adventure on Terraria but don't know what mod(s) to use?
                In this list you will be able to find my personal top 10 recommended mods for a Terraria playtrough
                so that you can make your modded Terraira experience a more unique and enjoyable one. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>
                    Note that I may have not completed a full playtrough with all of the mods listed
                    and some I may have not played with at all.

            <p class="disclaimer">
                The mods are not ranked in any particular order. This is not a top 10 list.

                    <h2>Overhaul</h2>

                <h3>
                    Try not to burn down your house the first time challenge (impossible)
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Overhaul does exactly what it sounds like. It overhauls the entire game
                    rather than bringing in new content like a lot of mods usually do.
                    Overhaul's main points are the new features and mechanics it adds to the base game
                    in order to make the game fresh again.
                    Some of the features are:
                    <ul>
                        <li class="featureList">
                            Revamped weapon system
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Revamped magic
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            New movement system
