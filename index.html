                    <h2>Overhaul</h2>
                </li>
                <div class="modImage">
                    <img src="./Overhaul.jpg" alt="Terraira Overhaul">
                </div>
                <h3>
                    Try not to burn down your house the first time challenge (impossible)
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Overhaul does exactly what it sounds like. It overhauls the entire game
                    rather than bringing in new content like a lot of mods usually do.
                    Overhaul's main points are the new features and mechanics it adds to the base game
                    in order to make the game fresh again.
                    Some of the features are:
                    <ul>
                        <li class="featureList">
                            Revamped weapon system
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Revamped magic
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            New movement system
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Brand new season system with reworked weather
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Social features such as emotes
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Enhanced enemy AI
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Brand new weakness and resistance system
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Flammable blocks (yes you can now set your house on fire)
                        </li>
                    </ul> 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A playtrough with these brand new features will add a whole new layer of
                    content and gameplay. Terraria will feel like a brand new game.
                </p>

                <h3>Feel powerless again (with Eternity mode)</h3>

                <p>
                    If you instead prefer to keep the mechanics of Terraria normal instead of revamping
                    them, you can try out Fargo's mod instead. This mod is split into different smaller mods
                    which add specific things to the game. The most noteable one is Fargo's soul. It adds brand new 
                    accesories and weapons as well as a new mechanic called enchantments. Enchantments provide 
                    bonuses of other armor sets and accesories. The mod even a new difficulty which provides all 
                    bosses in the game with unique buffs making them exponentially more powerful. If you enjoy hard 
                    difficulties in games, this mod might be for you. 
                </p>
                <p>Another bonus of this mod is that it is compatible with a lot of other mods too
                    so you can play with multiple different mods at the same time.

                    <h2>The Story of Red Cloud</h2>
                </li>

                <h3>Terraria with a better story</h3>

                <p>
                    Most people might only need the most popular mods in order to enhance their experience.
                    Majority of the other mods are either very small or they are quality of life mods
                    used for making your gameplay "easier". 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For those who are interested in more obscure and less popular mods, The Story of Red Cloud
                    is a very good choice to add to your game. This mod was created based on Terraria's engine to make an 
                    over-arching Dark Souls inspired storyline on top of the vanilla one. Alongside it comes a few 
                    new items, enemies, music and even bosses. A great mod for those that have 
                    "seen and done everything" in Terraria and are looking for something unique to play through.
                </p>

                        However, should you want an even bigger RPG Terraria experience, the next mod on the list
                        might be of your interest.

                <li>
                    <h3>Super Terraria World</h3>
                </li>

                <div class="modImage">
                    <img src="./World.avif" alt="Super Terraria World mod image">
                </div>
                <h3>The ACTUAL ultimate Terraria RPG experience</h3>

                <p>
                    In similar fashion to the last mod, Super Terraria World focuses on a RPG style when 
                    it comes to gameplay. A well developed story, many different classes and much more. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    What makes this mod different is that it is also an MMO, meaning that you will always be meeting other players. On top of that,
                    this mod connects multiple worlds together, making player feel like they are going on one massive adventure.
                    Mining is disabled due to most of the world not being destructable except in some cases where you have to solve
                    puzzles. 
                </p>

                <li>
                    <h2>Calamity</h2>

                <h3>How to win: get the Murasama (not really)</h3>

                <p>
                    Calamity is easily known as one of the most popular mods for Terraria. It acts as one 
                    very big update to Terraria, adding:
                    <ul>
                        <li>1880+ new items</li>
                        <li>275+ new enemies</li>
                        <li>24+ new bosses</li>
                        <li>A new type of bosses: superbosses</li>
                        <li>6 new biomes</li>
                        <li>5 new difficulties</li>
                        <li>New NPCs</li>
                    </ul>

                    making the mod feel up to date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Calamity is also known for the vast amount of items and references to other
                    series such as the Murasama from <em><b>Metal Gear Rising: Revengance</b></em> or MOAB wings
                    which reference the <em><b>Bloons Tower defense</b></em> games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides items, the mod adds 5 new difficulties which add new mechanics and change the how bosses work.
                    These difficulties may also contain some exclusive loot which can not be obtained otherwise.
                </p>
                <p>The Calamity mod has certainly earned its reputation as one of the best mods for Terraria.
                    Everyone should try this mod at least once.
